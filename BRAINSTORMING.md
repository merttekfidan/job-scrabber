# Job Scrabber: Strategic Brainstorming

After analyzing the current ecosystem, here is a roadmap to transform Job Scrabber from a "Tool" into an "Indispensable Career Operating System."

## 1. Strengthening Existing Features 💪

### A. From Data Extraction to "Strategic Mapping"
*   **The Gap**: Currently, the AI extracts what is *on the page*. 
*   **The Power-Up**: **Resume Matching**. Allow users to upload their CV. The AI should not just extract the job but instantly tell the user: *"You have 80% of the skills. Here is how to explain your lack of SQL experience by highlighting your Excel Data Modeling."*
*   **Actionable Next Step**: Add a "Resume Context" field to the extension settings.

### B. High-Fidelity Interview Prep
*   **The Gap**: Notes are good, but they are static.
*   **The Power-Up**: **Scenario-Based Coaching**. Generate 3 "Likely Questions" based on the specific job seniority and company culture, then provide a **STAR Method Template** for each.
*   **Actionable Next Step**: Update the prompt to include "Behavioral Psychology" in its persona.

### C. Dashboard "Pulse"
*   **The Gap**: The dashboard is a list. It should be a workflow.
*   **The Power-Up**: **Follow-up Engine**. Automatically flag applications that haven't been touched in 7 days with a "Send Follow-up?" button that generates a personalized email.
*   **Actionable Next Step**: Add a `last_contact_date` field to the database schema.

## 2. New "Wow" Features (Growth) 🚀

### A. The "Live Overlay" (Pre-Capture Insight)
*   **Concept**: Before capturing, show a small pill on the LinkedIn page: `[Low Match: Skill Gap - Python]` or `[High Salary Opportunity]`. 
*   **Value**: Saves the user time by filtering roles *before* they apply.

### B. Shadow-Market Intelligence
*   **Concept**: Use AI to analyze the company description and find recent news (Funding rounds, layoffs) to give the user a "Confidence Score" for that role.

### C. Multi-Persona Management
*   **Concept**: Users often apply for different types of roles (e.g., "Product Manager" vs "Marketing Manager"). Allow switching "Resume Personas" in the extension for different prep notes.

## 3. The "Product Hook" Strategy
To make this viral or highly sticky:
1.  **Weekly Report**: An automated email summary: *"You applied to 10 jobs this week. You are becoming a specialist in Fintech. Here are 3 other Fintech companies you should look at."*
2.  **Export to Portfolio**: Turn captures into a "Target Company List" they can share with mentors or career coaches.
